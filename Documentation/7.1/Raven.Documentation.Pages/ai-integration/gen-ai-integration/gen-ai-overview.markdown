# GenAI Integration: Overview
---

{NOTE: }

* The **GenAI** (Generative Artificial Intelligence) integration feature allows RavenDB to utilize 
  AI models (like OpenAI and Ollama) and gain intelligent automatization of data processing in 
  a production environment.  

* The AI models that your server utilizes can be either **Local** (like Ollama) so you can 
  test your GenAI tasks on your premises freely and without additional fees, or **External** 
  (like OpenAI) so you can leverage your favorite AI model and its access to external resources.
